                Ofc, things should work. That someone should make the effort to think it through, that the thing does the thing it’s supposed to do, in the simplest way possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                But also, just as importantly, that it actually feels like people made it. That i feel the care that was put into making it, the connection from the creators to the person who interacts with the creation.
              </p>
              <p>
                So, on every project i start with two questions. What does it do? We call that <strong className="text-gray-800">Function</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                And, how does using it make people feel? I call that <strong className="text-gray-800">Feeling</strong>.
              </p>
              <p>
                And then start creating.
              </p>

          {/* Pemisah antar bagian */}

          {/* === BAGIAN 2: WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO? === */}
          <div>
            <h2 className="text-4xl md:text-5xl font-bold text-gray-900">
              That’s nice. But what do you actually do?
            </h2>
            <div className="mt-12 space-y-10 text-base text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">

                <p>
                  <strong className="text-gray-900">Branding.</strong> What is it? Basically, it’s that feeling again. The overall vibe of a company, product, or experience. I've helped shape that for some amazing clients. Sure, i design (which  like to think of as part of a brand’s voice and tone). But also create the photos, videos, illustrations how everything moves, flows, and comes to life. I handle all of it.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  <strong className="text-gray-900">Products.</strong> So, what is it exactly? The things i make are mostly digital. You’ll find them behind a URL or tucked inside your phone. An app, a website, or some nifty little tool that does something. You tap a button, get a quick hit of dopamine fun, right? But it’s also about that feeling again. Why do you keep coming back? What makes this one different from the rest? Maybe another app delivers better pizza, but mine feels better to use, maybe it just makes you feel good about your choices. That’s the kind of experience i create for some of the apps you probably use every day.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div>
                <p>
                  <strong className="text-gray-900">Experiences.</strong> So what is it this time? Well, the things i create are digital. It could be an event, an activation. Maybe a dome where you ride a sleigh, or a website where you shop for perfume and become part of the story. When there’s something to sell, there’s always a story to tell a reason for people to care. And i’ve crafted plenty of those stories for some of the biggest brands.
